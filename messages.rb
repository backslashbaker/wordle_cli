      Guess a five-letter word in 5 attempts. Each time you guess, you are told which of your chosen letters are in the target word, and whether they are in the right place.
      2 = this letter is in this position
      1 = this letter is in the target word but not this position
      0 = this letter is either not in the target word, or is not in the target
